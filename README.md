# News Feed with NewsAPI
I just found out that NewsAPI developer plan doesn't allow HTTP requests, only from localhost. Yikes.

The app is only viewable through a local server.

## Run the local development server

- Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/maraski/codingchallenge.git`
- Install dependencies `npm install`
- Start the server `npm start`
